# Personal Page Structure

Create a svelte file, the name of the file will be used as the route for the file. For example, `bogos.svelte` page can be accessed on `/bogos`. The name of the file is case-sensitive.

If you want to create a reusable component, you can create more svelte files in the `../lib/{name}/` directory. The file naming for components file is to use CamelCase to differentiate custom component with the default HTML components.
